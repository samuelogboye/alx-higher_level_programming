# 0x00. Python - Hello, World
by Samuel Ogboye

## Learning Objectives
* Why Python programming is awesome
* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using print
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
* What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle

## Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu ```20.04 LTS``` using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

## Shell Scripts
* All your scripts are tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* All scripts are exactly two lines long (wc -l file prints 2)
* All files should end with a new line
* The first line of each shell file starts with #!/bin/bash
* All shell files are executable

## C Scripts
* All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options ```-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89```
* All files end with a new line
* C Code uses the Betty style. It can be checked using ```betty-style.pl``` and ```betty-doc.pl```
* Global variables are no used
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions is included in the header files.

## Zen
```
	The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

	Beautiful is better than ugly.
	Explicit is better than implicit.
	Simple is better than complex.
	Complex is better than complicated.
	Flat is better than nested.
	Sparse is better than dense.
	Readability counts.
	Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
	Although practicality beats purity.
	Errors should never pass silently.
	Unless explicitly silenced.
	In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
	There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
	Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
	Now is better than never.
	Although never is often better than *right* now.
	If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
	If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
	Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
